# TODO Need to figure out how to represent the network.
If using the loop detectors stations as nodes,
Graph should probably be directed.

# IMPORTANT NOTE
Can't do time series prediction as the accidents
are literally random.

This is solely a detection task i.e. a node classification task.

Due to the nature of the SUMO simulation, and the fact this is
a classification task, there is no point considering the current time step,
or order of the data.

# REDO SIMULATION
To only have 1 accident in simulation at any time.

Give mingming an informal technical demo on the 3rd of March.
